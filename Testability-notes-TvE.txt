# WHAT IS TESTABILITY
- Made of two words

- THE WORD "ABILITY"
The fact that someone or something is able to do something


- THE WORD "TEST"
Testing is the process of evaluating a product by learning about it through 
experiencing, exploring, and experimenting, which includes to some degree: 
questioning, study, modeling, observation, inference, etc.

# TESTABILITY IS EVERYWHERE - IN CARS
- Tire tread level indicators
- 1,6 mm => legal
	But remember if it's wet then you need at least 3 mm for safety

# WHAT IS TESTABILITY NOT
- Dieselgate
	Some "genius" made an algorithm that identified if the car was under test or not
		If under test: do not pollute
		if not under test: pollute like hell (order of a magnitude more)

- General practice today...
	BMW, Fiat, Chrysler, Jeep, Opel (General Motors), Nissan, Renault, Mercedes-Benz

- ...and in the past
	1973 Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen
	1996 General Motors
	1996 Fiat
	1998 Honda
