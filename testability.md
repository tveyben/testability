## TESTABILITY - CARS
- Tire tread level indicators
- 1,6 mm is the legal requirement
	- But ~3 mm is needed when it's raining
- Requires a minimum set of skills to use
	- Even a small child can do it

## TESTABILITY IS _NOT_
- Dieselgate!

```
if (car_is_under_test):
	behave_nice() # The authorities are watching us!
else:
	misbehave()   # And hope we'll not get caught…
```

- A "manifest" defines multiple technical variations
	- EG.: 1, 2, 4 & 8 Mbps
- Different clients gets different manifests (proxy-server)
	- Humax: 8 Mbps, iOS 4 Mbps

## DEMO CHALLENGES
- Our platform is _difficult_
- _[TvE00x]_ Requires a subscription for "C-More"
- Not possible to have "available for all" content (yet)


---

## TAKE AWAY
- If testing made is easy
	- it ***will*** be performed (much more)
- If testing is made difficult
	- it will ***not*** be performed (as much as needed)
- Must know the actual requirements
	- Client max bitrate

# Picasso?
***Good artists copy, great artists steal***

> A good artist will see another artists style and then try and emulate that style as closely as they can

> A great artist will select elements from another artists work and incorporate it into their own unique mix of influences
